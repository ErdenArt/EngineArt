# 2D Engine for MonoGame Framework

A lightweight 2D engine built on top of the **MonoGame Framework**, designed to make 2D games faster and easier.  
It provides all the essentials like tilemaps, colliders, and camera handling.
This small engine is made for being able to make quick prototypes. But also something you can expand more. 
Main apppeal to this engine is ability to connect anything to everything~

## 💟 What more you can expect to be added
- **Animation system** - I want to add sprite and 2D Rig animations
- **Time manager** - Everything will be on timeline that could be manipulated. No missing inputs and no missing frames
- **More UI elements** - Sliders, checkboxes, buttons etc.
- **Particle system** - Problematic thing to do because each particle is unique in it's own way, but I try to find a way that can fit well
- **More camera options** - Mainly pixel perfect camera, but also more options to modify camera
- **Raycasting** - Lasors
